Distributed Rendering of 3D images	Each frame can be assigned as a task to each node on the Hadoop Cluster. The Task could be any rendering algorithm which renders the image. Choice of rendering algorithm to be used is left to the implementer. 
Video conversion; Have water marks introduced as part of the conversion.	The video is sliced into segments. Each segment is assigned as a task to each node on the Hadoop Cluster. The task is to run the video conversion code. The system should be scalable. Techniques for load balancing should be explored and implemented in the program itself.
Implement Twitter	Simple web based application implementing the core functionalities of twitter. All the statuses can be stored in MongoDb.
Classified Marketplace for people in Rural India	The UI for this project should mimic magicbricks.com. User should be able to put up his classified with appropriate relevant details. Each classified should be represented in the form of an image with its metadata.
Classified Marketplace for people in Rural India: Categorization and Classification	Cater to categorization and classification using machine learning algorithms. There will not be UI elements in the UI. Instead it will be more like text like requirement, which would then be passed for categorization and classification to a set. This would be used later for search.
Classified Marketplace for people in Rural India: Android mobile interface	UI should be simple to use from an Android phone.
Classified Marketplace for people in Rural India: Search; support Indian languages and must use classfication.	Search first using English. Then other languages. Must use the classification and classification output from project 1. The search also should be location based as well.
Contextual Advertising	Simple context based advertising as we see in Google.com. For each query, the meta data of each advertisement is searched and the advertisements are displayed. Any valid ranking algorithm can be followed. Can be implemented on Google AppEngine or Hadoop with HBase or on MongoDb
Document Management System using cloud databases	"The portal should have the functionality to upload and download the files through the user accounts. The documents are stored along with their metadata. The search functionality should be able to search this metadata. Can be implemented on Google AppEngine or Hadoop with HBase or on MongoDb.
It should also support viewing of the documents and maintain the history of the documents such as how many users have viewed a particular document etc."
Non-intrusive, web based discounts and offer tracking system	Get the web-based discounts and offers related to a product based on category and location. The top-k results should be displayed and mailed to the registered users. 
Multilingual resume management system - Search	The Resumes in different Indian Languages are posted on to the portal through their user logins. The search functionality should be able to search the meta data of the resumes and also support all the Indian Languages. Can be implemented on Google AppEngine or Hadoop with HBase or on MongoDb
Hadoop Security	Hadoop should be able to manage user management similar to Linux. The private data of a user group on HDFS should be accessible only to its members.
Public grievance: Gathering	The grievance articles are to be crawled from various news articles, forums etc of english and Indian languages. Nutch should be used with Hadoop to crawl the data.
Public grievance: Two-class classification - grievance or not, and nature of grievance	The grievance articles collected are used to train a model which classifies whether the article is grievance or not. Classification or Clustering can be used to categorize the grievances. Should support Multiple Languages. Should use Mahout for classication and clustering.
Public grievance: Location Mapping and colour coding based on grievance severity and the number of grievances	The grievance articles are to be parsed to obtain the metadata related to the grievance. The grievances should be plotted on a map. Google Map API can be used for this. Can be implemented on Google AppEngine or Hadoop with HBase or on MongoDb
Use Hadoop for massive processing of car name plate recognition in a heap of huge set of images.	Use image processing techniques and print out all the name plates from the cars in image taken by camera in traffic junction.
